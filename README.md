# 🎄 Advent of Code 🎄

This repository gathers all my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), a series of daily programming puzzles published every December since 2015.

Each year has its own folder, tools, and language(s).
I use Advent of Code as both a fun challenge and a way to explore different programming languages (mainly Rust and Python, sometimes via Jupyter Notebooks).

I first discovered **Advent of Code** in 2020, and since then I’ve made it a habit to take part every December.  
At the time, while working full-time as a teacher, I only had a short amount of time each day — so I usually dropped out after a few puzzles (which clearly shows in the number of stars collected those years).  

Since I started learning **Rust** as part of my return to software engineering, I’ve been using Advent of Code as a way to practice and improve.  
I’ve therefore gone back to earlier editions (starting from 2015), and my long-term goal is to eventually solve *all* the puzzles, in Rust or other languages.

## 🚀 How to run

- See each year’s folder for specific instructions:
    - Rust projects (2015, 2016, 2017) → use `cargo test (--release)`.
    - Python Jupyter projects (2022–2024) → open the notebooks in Jupyter.
    - Python scripts (2020-2021) → run with Python 3.
