# 🎄 Advent of Code 2021 🎄

This folder contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), a series of daily programming puzzles published in December 2021.

## ✨ About

Each day consists of two related puzzles.  
This project is written in **Python**, mainly as quick scripts.  
At that time I was still working as a teacher, so I had limited time each day — hence the incomplete progress.

## 📦 Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## 🧠 Structure

- One folder per day (`day1`, `day2`, …).  
- Each folder contains a script `dayX.py`.  
- Input files are not committed, as they are unique per user, but locally save in the same folder as the conrresponding script.
